      <h1>INTERNATIONAL RETURNS</h1>

      <h3>non-furniture items</h3>
      <p>
        CB2 will accept merchandise returns of non-furniture items within 90
        days of customer receipt. For International Checkout online orders,
        refund amounts for returned items will be credited to you by our global
        partner, Borderfree, in the same currency and using the same exchange
        rate as your original order.
      </p>
      <h3>stock furniture items</h3>
      <p>
        If you are not satisfied with your Stock furniture purchase, you must
        contact us within 7 days of delivery or pickup to arrange a return. The
        item must be returned within 30 days of delivery or pickup. The item
        will be inspected upon return, and a refund amount will be determined
        based on its condition. Please notify us at customer_service@cb2.com or
        call (00+1) 630.388.4555, and we will provide you with further
        instructions on where returns should be shipped and the amount you will
        be refunded. For International Checkout online orders, refund amounts
        for returned items will be credited to you by our global partner,
        Borderfree, in the same currency and using the same exchange rate as
        your original order.

      <h3>special order upholstery items</h3>
      <p>
        We require a 50% deposit for all Stock Plus and Custom furniture items.
        These items are made to your specifications and cannot be returned or
        exchanged. Once you place your order, you have 72 hours to change or
        cancel. The 72-hour time frame begins as soon as you place your order in
        a store; for online orders, the 72-hour time frame begins once you
        confirm your fabric selection with a Customer Service representative.
        After 72 hours, your 50% deposit is nonrefundable. If a Stock Plus or
        Custom item arrives with a manufacturing defect or damage caused during
        transit, we will repair or replace the defective or damaged area. If
        that isnâ€™t possible, we will arrange an exchange. We reserve the right
        to determine the best course of action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note: CB2 stores are unable to accept returns from international
        orders purchased online at cb2.com through our global partner,
        Borderfree.
